# Bitcoin_ML
 
## Overview

The aim of this project was to use unsupervised ML to classify various cryptocurrencies for potential investments. To do so, several steps were taken in order to visualize the data. First, data was retrieved from cryptocompare and then columns were filtered out for various things: keeping only coins that are being traded, removing nulls, along with dropping unneccesary columns etc. We then used PCA to reduce the dimensions of our data set and then finally, clustered and visualized the data using K mean values and 3d scatter plots
